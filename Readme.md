## Description

This forms part of my fifth project with code institute.

This API is used to store and retrieve data from the database, as well as Register, login or logout users.
This app is designed to help solve the Property Market problem.
You can buy, rent, submit complaints or report maintenance issues.
You will also be able to see what maintenance contractor has been assigned to your maintenance issue.
